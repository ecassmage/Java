You will write a method named isMatched like below. It will return true for valid strings, and false for invalid strings. You will use
the stack named Stack2540Array that is implemented in the first step. The algorithm itself can be the same as in our lecture slides.
Your program does not need to check the correctness of the arithmetic operators/operands. What you need to do is to check for balanced
brackets.
Test the performance of your Stack implementation on file reversing task. The code below is to reverse a text file using the stack. It has
three lines missing, and you need to complete it. Then you submit it on our marking site here. You need to change the stack capacity
according to input data size. On average each line has about 11 words. Our site prints out the total computer memory usage by your
program when it runs on 5 data sets of different sizes.
